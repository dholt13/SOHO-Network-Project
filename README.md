I designed and implemented a Small Office Home Office Network using Packet Tracer, featuring three distinct departments: Admin/IT, Finance/HR, and Customer Service/Reception. Each department is equipped with separate VLANs and wireless networks, including access points for user connectivity. Through meticulous configuration, all devices within the network seamlessly communicate with one another, facilitating efficient workflow and collaboration across departments.
